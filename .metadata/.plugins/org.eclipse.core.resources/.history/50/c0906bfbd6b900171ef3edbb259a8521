 * The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. 
 * There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." 
 * Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. 
 * After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". 
 * It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
