 * Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. 
 * But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, 
 * which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; 
 * and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, 
 * and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
